title: Directions
content: "I am located in the X-wing of the ICICS/CS Building on UBC campus. The main address from the ICICS/CS building is 2366 Main Mall. If you enter from this address, follow the signs to the X-wing, then take the <span style='color: black'>south elevator</span> to the 6th floor. My office is X665. <br><br> The most direct way to get to my office is to enter the X-wing from street level (X-wing is it's own building, connected by walkways to the old building). The entrance is at the corner of Engineering Road and Agronomy Road, then take the <span style='color: black'>south elevator</span> to the 6th floor. <br><br> The <span style='color: black'>interactive</span> Google map shows the Engineering and Agronomy roads. <br><br> The closest parking is in the <a target='blank' href='http://maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?show=y,n,n,n,n,y&bldg2Search=&locat1=467'>Health Sciences Parkade</a>."
